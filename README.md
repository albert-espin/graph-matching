# Optimal Weighted Graph Matching

Program to find optimal (minimum-distance) pairs in graphs (described in ".dat" files, with some examples included), using branch and bound with a series of optimality-preserving heuristics; run "branch_bound.py" to try it. Additionally, a set of simpler heuristics is included in "simple_heuristics.py", while a faster greedy solver (that cannot guarantee optimality) can be found in "greedy.py".
